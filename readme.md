<b>APPLICATION SUMMARY</b>

This movie tracker is an MVC application that uses SQL and entity framework to create a database of the user's movies to watch as well as a database of movies they have already watched. The application has a home page, a page for the watch list, and a page for the completed list. The watch list page has a form where the user can enter the title, director, and summary of the movie they want to add. They can then add that movie to their list. The user can also bypass this form to simply view their list. Once they have watched a movie, they can then remove it from that list. The completed page works in a similar way. It has a form where the user can enter the title, director, and summary of the movie they have watched. In this form, however, they can also enter a rating for the movie to refer back to how much they liked it.
